This service will let you know through syslog if your external IP has changed.

Can be useful for those of you not trusting any dynamic DNS services out there etc.

Needs dnsutils installed (for the dig command).

To install on Debian based platforms:

: sudo cp has_my_ip_changed.sh /root

: sudo cp has_my_ip_changed.service /etc/systemd/system

: sudo systemctl start has_my_ip_changed.service

To test if working, see if /tmp/my_last_ip_address exists after a minute or so.

When IP address changes you will see something like this in syslog:

Feb 23 14:44:50 ubuntu has_my_ip_changed.sh[6209]: IP address changed from a.b.c.d to e.f.g.h
